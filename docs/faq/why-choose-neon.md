### What are the main advantages of Neon EVM?

The Neon EVM is built as a smart contract on Solana. It benefits from low gas fees (at a cost of no less than
0.000015 SOL per transaction) and high throughput (up to 4,500 Ethereum-like transactions per second).

The advantages are all accomplished without significant changes to existing Ethereum smart contract code.
In addition, Neon EVM provides access to familiar Ethereum developer tools (i.e. MetaMask, Remix, Truffle).

### How are the costs of Neon EVM so low while maintaining a high transaction throughput?

These two benefits are the result of Neon EVM working on Solana.

The main benefit of throughput comes from the parallel execution of transactions enabled by Solana.

The low costs of Neon EVM transactions are attributed to the low costs of Solana transactions.

### Are there any dApps currently running on Neon EVM?

The Neon Labs team has launched NeonSwap, a fork of Uniswap V2 with no code changes, on the Neon EVM testnet.
