The forum is a place where Neon developers and third-party teams can discuss and debate ideas and express and articulate their opinions on proposals. The forum is a vital part of Neon's governance structure, because it provides transparency and accountability, fosters constructive discourse, and helps ensure the decentralization of the project. 

## Rules and Etiquettes

The forum is not the place for general discussions, advertising, off-topic conversations, or political discussions.

1. All users are equal. No single user or group of users can have undue influence over the governance process.

2. Decisions are made based on consensus. All users have an equal say in the decision-making process, and decisions are only made when there is broad agreement among the community.

3. Transparency is key. All users must have access to all relevant information in order to make informed decisions. The governance process must be open and transparent to all.

4. Decentralized governance is flexible. The governance process should be flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of the community.

5. Users are accountable for their actions. All users must be held accountable for their actions and decisions within the governance process. There must be mechanisms in place to ensure that users act in the best interests of the community.
