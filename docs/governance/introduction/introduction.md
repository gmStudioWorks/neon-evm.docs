## Neon is Governed by the Community, For the Community

The goal of the Neon DAO is to allow the community of token holders to have a say in how the protocol evolves. The Neon DAO includes core developers, application developers, operators, users, and other contributors in order to come to a consensus on solving issues and developing rules for the functioning of governance. The rules can be changed by contractual amendments as decided by the stakeholders.

The Neon DAO is the name for the collection of organisations that allow Neon community stakeholders to:
  * Reach consensus on solving issues that cannot be fully covered by software algorithms
  * Develop rules for the functioning of the Neon DAO in accordance with the decisions stakeholders make, and record and store rules on the blockchain
  * Change the governance rules themselves through contractual amendments

Since the results depend on Neon's stability, a high level of coordination must be ensured when making changes to the management and technical processes. This ensure that any changes to Neon are secure and approved by the community. It is also necessary to make the process of resolving issues related to Neon management transparent.
