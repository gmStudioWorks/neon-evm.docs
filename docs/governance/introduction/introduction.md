## Neon is Governed by the Community, For the Community

The goal of the Neon DAO is to allow the community of token holders to have a say in how the protocol evolves. The Neon DAO includes core developers, application developers, operators, users, and other contributors in order to come to a consensus on solving issues and developing rules for the functioning of governance. The rules can be changed by contractual amendments as decided by the stakeholders.

Since the results depend on Neon's stability, a high level of coordination must be ensured when making changes to the management and technical processes. This ensure that any changes to Neon are secure and approved by the community. It is also necessary to make the process of resolving issues related to Neon management transparent.

## Principles and Objectives

To ensure that the Neon DAO works smoothly and is effective at implementing the community's vision, there are a few guiding principles that people engaging with this DAO must follow. These include:

* Respecting the rights of all Neon community members
* Acting in good faith
* Seeking to resolve disputes in a constructive and collaborative manner
* Encouraging a diversity of perspectives
* Promoting openness and transparency

There are also more concrete prohibitions on improper behavior that must be kept in mind, including that:

* Members must not threaten other members.
* No member should improperly influence the vote of another.
* Members agree to hold software developers blameless for unintentional mistakes made by them in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.

In addition, the NEON DAO is transparent and flexibile. All users have access to all relevant information in order to make well-informed decisions, and the governance process is adaptable to the ever-evolving needs of the community.
