*The purpose of this guide is to familiarize you with the structure of Neon EVM, and to provide step-by-step instructions to set up your local Neon EVM development environment.*

## Setting Up the Development Environment

As a developer, you should begin by exploring the Neon EVM framework and setting up your local development environment.
Depending on your purposes, there are several ways to do it:

[ðŸ”˜ Choosing a Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/choosing_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to connect to an existing Neon Proxy.  
[ðŸ”˜ Connecting to the Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/connect_to_solana_via_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to connect to the Solana cluster via a local or remote proxy server.  
[ðŸ”˜ Setting up a local Solana cluster](developing/dev_environment/solana_cluster/cluster_installation.md) â€” Describes how to install, configure, and test the local Solana cluster with Neon EVM onboard.  

## Deploying dApps

[ðŸ”˜ Using Remix](developing/deploy_facilities/using_remix.md) â€” Example of deploying smart contracts using Remix.  
[ðŸ”˜ Using Truffle](developing/deploy_facilities/using_truffle.md) â€” Example of deploying smart contracts using Truffle.  
[ðŸ”˜ Using Hardhat](developing/deploy_facilities/using_hardhat.md) â€” Example of deploying smart contracts using Hardhat.  

## Neon EVM Architecture

[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum and Solana capabilities in a single solution](architecture/eth_sol_solution.md) â€” Describes a unique solution that allows Ethereum users to use the key features of Solana and vice versa.  
[ðŸ”˜ Overview of Neon EVM architecture](architecture/neon_evm_arch.md) â€” Describes the architectural solutions built into Neon EVM that enable fast transaction processing for Ethereum users.  

## Fundamental Topics

If you are new to Neon EVM development, we recommend starting from the very beginning and moving forward in order through each of the topics.  

[ðŸ”˜ Web2 versus Web3](architecture/core_aspects/web3.md) â€” Describes the fundamental differences between Web2 and Web3.  
[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum account](architecture/core_aspects/account.md) â€” An entity with an ETH balance that can send transactions on Ethereum.  
[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum transaction](architecture/core_aspects/transaction.md) â€” A cryptographically signed instruction from an account.  
[ðŸ”˜ Block](architecture/core_aspects/block.md) â€” A special structure for recording a group of transactions in blockchain systems.  
[ðŸ”˜ Gas](architecture/core_aspects/gas.md) â€” Computational power represented in tokens. Required to process transactions.
