*The purpose of this guide is to familiarize you with the structure of Neon EVM, and to provide step-by-step instructions to set up your local Neon EVM development environment.*

## Setting up the development environment
As a developer, you should begin by exploring the Neon EVM framework and setting up your local development environment.
Depending on your purposes, there are several ways how to do it:

[ðŸ”˜ Choosing a Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/choosing_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to connect to existing Neon Proxy.  
[ðŸ”˜ Connecting to the Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/choosing_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to Connect to the Solana cluster via local or remote proxy server..  
[ðŸ”˜ Setting up local Solana Cluster](developing/dev_environment/choosing_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to install, configure and test the local Solana cluster with Neon EVM on-board.  

## Neon EVM Architecture
[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum and Solana capabilities in a single solution](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/architecture/eth_sol_solution) â€” Describes a unique solution that allows Ethereum users to use the key features of Solana and vice versa.  
[ðŸ”˜ Overview of Neon EVM Architecture](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/architecture/neon_evm_arch) â€” Describes the architectural solutions built into Neon EVM that enable fast transaction processing for Ethereum users.  

## Fundamental topics
If you are new to Neon EVM development, we recommend starting from the very beginning and moving forward in order through each of the topics.  

[ðŸ”˜ Web2 versus Web3](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/web3) â€” Describes the fundamental differences between Web2 and Web3.  
[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum account](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/account) â€” An entity with an ETH balance that can send transactions on Ethereum.  
[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum transaction](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/transaction) â€” A cryptographically signed instruction from an account.  
[ðŸ”˜ Block](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/block) â€” A special structure for recording a group of transactions in blockchain systems.  
[ðŸ”˜ Gas](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/gas) â€” Computational power represented in tokens. Required to process transactions.
