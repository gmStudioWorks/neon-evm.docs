title: Setting up a Local Solana Cluster
---

*This step-by-step guide describes how to install, configure, and test the local Solana cluster with Neon EVM onboard. It will help new developers create their own environment and run Ethereum programs wrapped into the Neon EVM.*

The [Neon EVM](https://neon-labs.org/) is a solution that performs transaction execution outside layer 1. The development process can be run on any modern Linux or Mac system, though this document is based on an Ubuntu 20.04 experience.

All the services in the **`Neon EVM environment`** presented by the docker-compose configuration files can be interchangeably substituted with their experimental versions in order to develop and test each service independently. To resolve issues, the Neon engineer has to be able to replace any service with a customized one according to the current requirements. You are welcome to change the following `docker-compose` configuration files based on your needs. You can also combine them in a single docker-compose file, though it is important to provide dependencies according to the following sequence.

Before you start to build your local environment, make sure you have all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** — for docker installation, please follow instructions at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- **Docker Compose** — Docker Compose is required to start up containers at: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- **Solana Tool Suite** — for interaction with Solana, we need to install Solana CLI Tools: https://docs.solana.com/ru/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
- A Chromium-based **browser** — for [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
* **Node package manager** — [Node.js/npm](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp) to interact with he Neon EVM with [Web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and [Eth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-eth) modules.

## Setting up the Neon Local Workspace Environment

Currently, the most flexible way to setup the environment is to use the set of independent docker containers sharing the common external network. To create the network called **`local`** that will be used over the docker containers, just input the following command:

```bash
docker network create local
```

If you want to bind some ports from the service to the host machine to be able to connect them and work with a service independently, just extend a `docker-compose.yml` configuration with the `ports` instruction. For example, you can bind the Solana (8899, 8900)- or Proxy (9090)-related ports to the host machine this way.

After setting up the local network, it is time to start the Solana validator service and EVM loader service containers.

### Step 1: Solana Validator Service

This service presents the Solana validator running inside the container.

Once you deploy the environment, you will have the Solana RPC endpoint working from the docker container at port `8899`. A folder named `solana_state` will be created also and it contains the Solana ledger to keep the state over restarts. If you need to reset the ledger, just remove this folder and it will be recreated the next time you run `docker-compose`.

#### docker-compose.yml

    version: "3"

    services:
      solana:
        container_name: solana
        image: neonlabsorg/solana:${SOLANA_REVISION:-v1.9.12-testnet}
        environment:
          SOLANA_URL: http://solana:8899
          RUST_LOG: solana_runtime::system_instruction_processor=trace,solana_runtime::message_processor=debug,solana_bpf_loader=debug,solana_rbpf=debug
        expose:
          - 8899
          - 8900
        networks:
          - net
        healthcheck:
          test: [ CMD-SHELL, "solana cluster-version -u http://solana:8899" ]
          interval: 5s
          timeout: 10s
          retries: 10
          start_period: 10s
        volumes:
          - "./solana_state:/opt/solana/config/"

    networks:
      net:
        external: yes
        name: local

#### How to Run it in Bash

    docker-compose -f solana/docker-compose.yml pull
    docker-compose -f solana/docker-compose.yml up -d

### Step 2: EVM Loader Service

This container helps deploy onto Solana the Neon EVM base contract, which listens for incoming connections on the port `8899`. It is important to note that this container does **not** work as a daemon, it simply uploads the Neon EVM contract and finishes with a return code of `0`.

#### docker-compose.yml

    version: "3"

    services:
      evm_loader:
        container_name: evm_loader
        image: neonlabsorg/evm_loader:latest
        environment:
          - SOLANA_URL=http://solana:8899
        networks:
          - net
        command: bash -c "create-test-accounts.sh 1 && deploy-evm.sh && /opt/spl-token create-account HPsV9Deocecw3GeZv1FkAPNCBRfuVyfw9MMwjwRe1xaU && /opt/spl-token mint HPsV9Deocecw3GeZv1FkAPNCBRfuVyfw9MMwjwRe1xaU 1000000000 --owner /opt/evm_loader-keypair.json -- HX14J4Pp9CgSbWP13Dtpm8VLJpNxMYffLtRCRGsx7Edv"

    networks:
      net:
        external: yes
        name: local

#### How to Run it in Bash

       docker-compose -f evm-loader/docker-compose.yml pull
       docker-compose -f evm-loader/docker-compose.yml up

## Logs

After following the previous steps, you will have four running containers for the Neon EVM local environment: **`solana`**, **`postgres`**, **`proxy`**, **`indexer`**:

```
49c864f47ccd   neonlabsorg/solana:v1.9.12-testnet   "./run.sh"               About an hour ago   Up About an hour (healthy)   8003/udp, 0.0.0.0:8899-8900->8899-8900/tcp, :::8899-8900->8899-8900/tcp, 9900/tcp   solana

5a7df37069fc   postgres:14.0                        "docker-entrypoint.s…"   47 hours ago        Up About an hour (healthy)   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp                                                            postgres
```

To look for events or errors, just run the `docker logs` for either the `solana` or `proxy` container:

```sh
docker logs -f solana 2>&1 | grep -v "Program Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
docker logs -f proxy
```

## Remix and MetaMask with the Neon EVM

Set up the "MetaMask" Chromium extension to connect to the proxy via Custom RPC at `http://localhost:9090/solana`. The following image describes how to set up the local Solana connection:  

<div className='neon-img-box-300' style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>  

![](../img/cluster-install-1.png)

</div>

Note: Once you create or import a new account in MetaMask, some NEON tokens will be airdropped into it.

Open Remix (also in Chromium) and select `Injected Web3` environment. You can deploy EVM-wrapped smart contracts on Solana and input these instructions:

</div>

## Truffle Suite with Neon EVM

Truffle is a popular platform to deploy and test Solidity programs. This section shows you how to check the compatibility of the Neon EVM and the Truffle suite.

In the new terminal, create a Truffle project and deploy contracts into the EVM:

```sh
sudo npm install -g truffle
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
truffle init
npm install web3 @truffle/hdwallet-provider
```

### Common Truffle Settings

Put your `truffle-config.js` into the Truffle root:

```sh
echo 'const Web3 = require("web3");

const Web3eth = require("web3-eth");
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");

const web3eth = new Web3eth();
const accs = Array.from(Array(10), (_, x) => web3eth.accounts.create());
const privateKeys = accs.map((account) => account.privateKey);

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    solana: {
      provider: new HDWalletProvider(privateKeys, "http://127.0.0.1:9090/solana"),
      from: accs[0].publicKey,
      network_id: "111",
    }
  },

  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.9"
    }
  }
};' > truffle-config.js
```

### Contract Creation

Create a trivial contract at `contracts/Storage.sol`:

```sh
echo '// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract Storage {
    uint256 number;

    function put(uint256 num) public {
        number = num;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return number;
    }
}' > contracts/Storage.sol
```

### Testing

You can now start testing `Storage` invocations with Truffley:

```sh
echo 'const Storage = artifacts.require("Storage");

contract("Storage", (accounts) => {
    let storage;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        storage = await Storage.new();
    });

    it("should store a value", async () => {
        const setResult = await storage.put(248);
        assert.equal(setResult.receipt.status, true);
        const value = await storage.get();
        assert.equal(value, 248);
    })
})' > test/Storage.test.js

truffle test test/Storage.test.js --network solana
```

### Possible Problems

If, for some reason, you remove the Solana container and run it again, then all related accounts stored in foreign systems become invalid from that moment on. To avoid this, re-run the proxy container and reset the state of MetaMask and Truffle as well, to make all relations consistent.

To reset the MetaMask state, follow the steps at `Settings`, `Advanced`, `Reset Account`.

The Truffle state can be reset by redeploying it in the following way:

```sh
truffle compile --network solana --reset
```
