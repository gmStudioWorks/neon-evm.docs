title: Why Neon EVM
---

*Neon EVM is viable solution for anyone who is looking to scale Ethereum dApps on Solana in a developer-friendly manner and get access the growing Solana Ecosystem*

## Neon EVM

Neon EVM is a viable solution that allows dApp developers to access the advantages of Solana to expand their services, to offer new products like arbitrage or high-frequency trading, grow their user base, and decrease costs where possible, including gas fees. Neon EVM enables full compatibility with Ethereum on Solana.

The solution allows any Ethereum application to be run on Solana without any changes to its codebase, including Uniswap, SushiSwap, 0x, and MakerDAO. All key Ethereum dApp tools can also work on Solana, including Solidity, MetaMask, Remix, and Truffle.

So Neon EVM is best suited to developers who want to enjoy a first-mover advantage and reach new customers on Solana, or those who want to scale with the low gas fees and high throughput that Solana provides. It is also good for developers looking to tap into liquidity on Solana.

## The Best from Ethereum World

Ethereum is set to remain a booming blockchain ecosystem. The number of active dApps on Ethereum is hovering above 300, and the number of active users of these dApps is close to 6 million, with the number of transactions on the rise. Ethereumâ€™s popularity is not only down to its processing of smart contracts, but also its sophisticated infrastructure for application development.

* Familiar languages: Solidity, Vyper
* Well-known Ethereum tools: MetaMask, Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, etc.
* Ethereum RPC API compatibility
* Ethereum Accounts, Signatures, Token standarts (ERC-20, ERC-721)
* No code changes required

## The Best from Solana World

Solana is one of the most technically advanced and innovative blockchains, offering low gas fees and high throughput of transactions. Among these innovations is its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system, which is reinforced via a Proof-of-History protocol, a transaction parallelization technology that optimizes resources and ensures that Solana can scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs, along with an optimized mempool system that speeds up throughput.

* parallel execution of transactions
* low gas fee - number from site
* high transaction speed - number from site
* access to the growing Solana Ecosystem
* uses Solana consensus mechanism and state, no additional validators
